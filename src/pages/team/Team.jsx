		Rafatur Rahman, known as Raffi, grew up watching his father, a hardworking businessman, dedicate himself day and night to provide for the family. Seeing his father’s determination and entrepreneurial spirit, this experience left a lasting impression on young Raffi, inspiring him to follow a similar path.
		</p>
    <p className=' text-[16px] text-gray-600 font-semibold gradient-text'>
		At just 13 years old, Raffi began selling Coca-Cola from his father’s convenience store in Bangladesh. This early foray into business taught him the fundamentals of selling and customer service. It was here that he learned the value of hard work, perseverance, and the importance of building something from the ground up.
		</p>
    <p className=' text-[16px] text-gray-600 font-semibold gradient-text'>
		When Raffi’s family moved to Canada, he embraced new challenges, starting out as a rug puller. Despite the humble beginning, Raffi was determined to succeed. He soon joined some of Canada’s biggest retailers as a part-time associate, working tirelessly and steadily climbing the ranks into management roles. With over 12 years of business management experience, he developed strong leadership skills and a keen understanding of operations.
		</p>
    
	  <p className=' text-[16px] text-gray-600 font-semibold gradient-text' >
		Raffi’s entrepreneurial ambitions didn’t stop there. Leveraging his 15 years of retail experience, he ventured into owning and managing around 17 businesses across different sectors. His journey as an Amazon seller also became a defining chapter of his career, where he successfully sold thousands of products, solidifying his expertise in e-commerce.
		</p>
	  <p className='text-[16px] text-gray-600 font-semibold gradient-text'>
		From witnessing his father’s determination to running multiple businesses, Raffi’s story is a testament to resilience, ambition, and the power of hard work. Today, he continues to inspire those around him, proving that with dedication and a vision, anything is possible.
